		<h1>Data Science Projects</h1>
		<p>Below is a list of data science projects I've worked on and some of the skills I've developed throughout:
	
  <h2><a href="https://www.bristol.ac.uk/golding/impact/project-case-studies/genroc-study/">GenROC</a>: Using data to better represent children with rare genetic conditions <h2>
	<p>I have been working with Dr Karen Low and her team on the GenROC project since February 2024. The project is a study of children with rare genetic syndromes and the work has involved data processing 
	and cleaning of survey data. One area of interest is the use of Human Phenotype <a href="https://hpo.jax.org/">(HPO)</a> codes which are used by clinicians to describe physical expressions of genetic variations.
	Parents also can provide free text descriptions of their child's phenotypes which can then be labelled with HPO codes by clinical experts for direct comparison. We are currently investigating the amount of information
	provided by parents on these phenotypes and how it compares with that of doctors in both quantity and detail. Publication pending!
	My inner NLP nerd is quite interested in the challenge of semi-automatically processing free text descriptions direclty into HPO codes!</p>
	  
  <h2><a href="https://jeangoldinginstitute.blogs.bristol.ac.uk/2024/09/02/working-towards-more-universal-skin-cancer-identification-with-ai/">Working towards more universal skin cancer identification with AI</a> <h2>
	<p>Working with James Pope, Ayush Joshi and Will Chapman on a JGI Seedcorn project, the work was about quantifying the disparate impact of skin tone when trying to deduce if a cancer lesion is benign or malignant.

	The problem becomes more difficult when you consider that we don't have skin tone labels for all of your images and that skin cancer lesions are not regular in shape. 
	This means that getting a computer vision model to work out what part of an image is the lesion itself is an interesting problem itself. I trained and tested various RESNET neural networks using PyTorch as well as 
	performing exploratory data analysis of the ISIC dataset to try to infer what signals (if any) images gave off corresponding to their labelled skintone. Publication pending!</p>
	  
  <h2><a href="https://www.climatebristol.org/people/huw-day/">Lived Experiences of extreme weather in the UK project </a> <h2>
	  <p>Working with Eunice Lo and Joanne Godwin on a JGI costed project, they had collected survey responses about peoples' lived experiences during extreme weather conditions in Bristol. 
	  As part of their survey they had collected free text responses to questions of the form "How did you adjust to the extreme heat?" (as well as for cold and floods). 
	  Of interest was what sorts of themes emerged from these free text responses.
	  
	  I used BERTopic to perform topic modelling, which is the NLP task of essentially clustering text responses. I wrote code for extracting and pre-processing the sentences, implementing BERTopic and visualising the results.
	At the end of this project, I gave a talk to the climate dynamics group on how BERTopic works. You can see all my code, as well as my PowerPoint presentation + Zoom recording of my talk on the <a href="https://github.com/HuwWDay/ClimateTopicModelling">GitHub repo</a>.
	Publication pending!</p>

<h2><a href="https://jeangoldinginstitute.blogs.bristol.ac.uk/2024/08/07/children-of-the-90s-and-synthetic-health-data/">Children of the 90s and Synthetic Health Data Seedcorn Project</a> <h2>
    	<p>Working with Mark Mumme, Eleanor Walsh, Dan Smith and Debbie Johnson on a JGI funded Seedcorn project, we investigated the premise of using synthetic data generation methods to develop a synthetic version of
	the ALSPAC (Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children) dataset. We surveyed researchers who had previously accessed ALSPAC data on what sort of synthetic data they would be interested in.
	My role was to provide expertise on the data science specific aspect, giving insight into methods for generating and benchmarking synthetic data. </p>
	  
	  <h1>Teaching</h1>
	  <p>I really love teaching and I've been fortunate enough to be involved with teaching throughout my masters, PhD and current role at JGI. See below for details: 

<h2>Intro to Python</h2>
	<p>Alongside my JGI colleagues, I have helped teach introduction Python courses for MSc Bioinformatics students as well as PhD students on the Technology Enhanced Chemical Synthesis, Practice-Oriented Artifical Intelligence programs and some researchers from the ESRC Centre for Sociodigital Future.
	I have taught Beginners Python, Intermediate Python, Intro to Data Analysis in Python and Applied Data Analysis in Python both as session lead and in class helper. The original version of these courses, taught by Matt Williams, were how I learnt to code during my PhD.
	You can see all the teaching notes we used <a href="https://bristol-training.github.io/">here!</a> </p>
	
<h2>MATH10015 Linear Algebra (2019)</h2>
	<p>During my PhD I ran tutorials for <a href="https://www.bris.ac.uk/unit-programme-catalogue/UnitDetails.jsa?ayrCode=19%2F20&unitCode=MATH10015">first year Linear Algebra.</a>
	I studied linear algebra extensively during my undergraduate but it took me far longer to develop a robust intuitive understanding of the concepts involved. Alongside giving hints for and marking homework, 
	I tried to flesh out a more geometric intuition for the concepts, inspired by the <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab&si=m9iKzRWT9zArjoCY">Essence of linear algebra series<\a> by YouTuber 3Blue1Brown.
	One of my fondest memories on my entire PhD is bumping into one of my undergraduate students two years later as they were coming to the end of their degree and being told how much of a positive impact I made on their development during their first year :) 
	</p>

<h2>MATH30016 Random Matrix Theory (2022)</h2>
	<p>During my PhD I ran tutorials for <a href="https://www.bris.ac.uk/unit-programme-catalogue/UnitDetails.jsa?ayrCode=21%2F22&unitCode=MATH30016">third year Random Matrix Theory.</a>
	I was responsible for giving hints for and marking homework (including formative assessments) as well as explaining key ideas from classes. 
	Random Matrix Theory was a core part of my PhD (my supervisor, Professor Nina Snaith, was teaching the module) so I was able to relate ideas in class to real research.
	I had the additional challenge of running all of my sessions online during the pandemic. Teaching an optional 9am class on Zoom and getting students to engage and ask questions was challenging but ultimately rewarding.
	Students eating breakfast or still in their PJs would share camera and interact and I fondly recall one session where due to the short homework sheet, I didn't have much content to go over. 
	None of the students had any more questions for me and at the 20 minute mark I assured students they were not obligated to stay but I'd stick around if they had any more questions. As it was the height of the pandemic, they explained to me they had nothing better to do.
	So to keep them entertained I gave them a crash course on what my research was about and how it related to their studies.
	</p>

<h2>MATH20008 Probability 2 (2018)</h2>
		
<h2><a href="datahazards.com">Data Hazards Co-Lead </a><h2>
	<p>As the JGI point of contact for the Data Hazards project, I helped run sessions for masters students in scientific computing and education cohorts. 
	I also have run data hazards events for active researchers and presented the Data Hazards project at HACA 2023 and RSS 2024 alongside the project founders and two dear friends of mine, Dr Natalie Zelenka and Dr Nina Di Cara. </p>
<h2><a href="https://jeangoldinginstitute.blogs.bristol.ac.uk/2024/07/03/empowering-schools-to-improve-the-data-literacy-of-young-people/">DataFace JGI Script Writer and Video Presenter </a><h2>

	<h1>Managing, Mentoring and Leadership</h1>
	<p> Yes I can do the nerd stuff, but I think I excel in the people skills department and I've really enjoyed managing, leading and mentoring people in various parts of my job. See below for examples:</p>

<h2>Intern Supervisor for <a href="https://jeangoldinginstitute.blogs.bristol.ac.uk/2024/09/04/chakaya-nyamvulas-jgi-placement/">Exploring Methods of Generating Synthetic Versions of Electronic Health Records</a> <h2>
