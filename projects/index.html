		<h1>Data Science Projects</h1>
		<p>Below is a list of data science projects I've worked on and some of the skills I've developed throughout:
	
  <h2><a href="https://www.bristol.ac.uk/golding/impact/project-case-studies/genroc-study/">GenROC</a>: Using data to better represent children with rare genetic conditions <h2>
	<p>I have been working with Dr Karen Low and her team on the GenROC project since February 2024. The project is a study of children with rare genetic syndromes and the work has involved data processing 
	and cleaning of survey data. One area of interest is the use of Human Phenotype <a href="https://hpo.jax.org/">(HPO)</a> codes which are used by clinicians to describe physical expressions of genetic variations.
	Parents also can provide free text descriptions of their child's phenotypes which can then be labelled with HPO codes by clinical experts for direct comparison. We are currently investigating the amount of information
	provided by parents on these phenotypes and how it compares with that of doctors in both quantity and detail. 
	My inner NLP nerd is quite interested in the challenge of semi-automatically processing free text descriptions direclty into HPO codes!</p>
	  
  <h2><a href="https://jeangoldinginstitute.blogs.bristol.ac.uk/2024/09/02/working-towards-more-universal-skin-cancer-identification-with-ai/">Working towards more universal skin cancer identification with AI</a> <h2>
	<p>Working with James Pope, Ayush Joshi and Will Chapman on a JGI Seedcorn project, the work was about quantifying the disparate impact of skin tone when trying to deduce if a cancer lesion is benign or malignant.

	The problem becomes more difficult when you consider that we don't have skin tone labels for all of your images and that skin cancer lesions are not regular in shape. 
	This means that getting a computer vision model to work out what part of an image is the lesion itself is an interesting problem itself. I trained and tested various RESNET neural networks using PyTorch as well as 
	performing exploratory data analysis of the ISIC dataset to try to infer what signals (if any) images gave off corresponding to their labelled skintone.</p>
	  
  <h2><a href="https://www.climatebristol.org/people/huw-day/">Lived Experiences of extreme weather in the UK project </a> <h2>

<h2><a href="https://jeangoldinginstitute.blogs.bristol.ac.uk/2024/08/07/children-of-the-90s-and-synthetic-health-data/">Children of the 90s and Synthetic Health Data Seedcorn Project</a> <h2>
    	<p>Working with Mark Mumme, Eleanor Walsh, Dan Smith and Debbie Johnson on a JGI funded Seedcorn project, we investigated the premise of using synthetic data generation methods to develop a synthetic version of
	the ALSPAC (Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children) dataset. We surveyed researchers who had previously accessed ALSPAC data on what sort of synthetic data they would be interested in.
	My role was to provide expertise on the data science specific aspect, giving insight into methods for generating and benchmarking synthetic data. </p>
	  
	  <h1>Teaching</h1>
	  <p>I really love teaching and I've been fortunate enough to be involved with teaching throughout my masters, PhD and current role at JGI. See below for details: 

<h2>Teaching: Intro to Python</h2>

<h2>Teaching: Linear Algebra</h2>

<h2>Teaching: Random Matrix Theory</h2>

<h2><a href="datahazards.com">Data Hazards Co-Lead </a><h2>

<h2><a href="https://jeangoldinginstitute.blogs.bristol.ac.uk/2024/07/03/empowering-schools-to-improve-the-data-literacy-of-young-people/">DataFace JGI Script Writer and Video Presenter </a><h2>

	<h1>I have soft skills too!</h1>
	<p> Yes I can do the nerd stuff, but I think I excel in the people skills department and I've really enjoyed managing, leading and mentoring people in various parts of my job. See below for examples:</p>

<h2>Intern Supervisor for <a href="https://jeangoldinginstitute.blogs.bristol.ac.uk/2024/09/04/chakaya-nyamvulas-jgi-placement/">Exploring Methods of Generating Synthetic Versions of Electronic Health Records</a> <h2>
