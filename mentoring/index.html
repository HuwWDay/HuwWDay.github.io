<h1>Managing, Mentoring and Leadership</h1>
	<p>Yes I can do the nerd stuff, but I think I excel in the people skills department and I've really enjoyed managing, leading and mentoring people in various parts of my job. See below for examples:</p>
  
<h2><a href="https://jgibristol.github.io/ask-jgi-handbook/pages/intro.html">Ask-JGI data science helpdesk Lead</a> <h2>
<p>As part of my role as a Data Scientist at the JGI, I currently lead the Ask-JGI helpdesk. The Ask-JGI helpdesk is a free at point of use service for all researchers at the University of Bristol, providing a day of free support provided by paid, part time PhD students from across the university.
  Having worked in a supporting role to the Ask-JGI service in my first year on the job, I was keen to step into a leadership role. I handled the advertising, recruitment and induction of the 2024/25 Ask-JGI cohort and function as the primary liason between the core JGI staff and the Ask-JGI PhD students.
  The whole ethos of Ask-JGI is that anyone who wants to engage with data science at UoB should be supported in doing so, which means we get to interact with all sorts of researchers from the university and handle a huge variety of queries. 
  Thanks to the diverse skillset of the Ask-JGI team, we handle queries about topics such as study design, optimising code for high powered computing applications, routine data analysis tasks and more sophisticated machine learning applications.
  The Ask-JGI mailbox is also the main point of contact for researchers interested in costing out core JGI Data Science staff on grants. As the Ask-JGI Lead, I am responsible for handling these queries, liasing with JGI Management and the core data science team to discuss suitability of various grants and advising on relevant technical aspects. </p>
  
  <p>By far the most rewarding aspect of being Ask-JGI Lead is working with the Ask-JGI students. Mentoring and supporting them run the helpdesk is extremely rewarding and it makes me very happy to see how well they're doing in their roles and how much of a positive impact they have across the university!</p>

  <h2><a href="dataethicsclub.com">Data Ethics Club Co-Organiser </a><h2>
<p>Data Ethics Club is a “journal” club about doing data science ethically. “Journal” because we will also read blog posts, (parts of) books, listen to podcasts or watch videos. It was founded by Dr Natalie Zelenka and Dr Nina Di Cara in January 2020 and I joined shortly after, keen to learn more about how we can think about the role ethics plays in data science applications. I volunteered to help write the blog in summer of 2020, summarising discussions based on notes made by attendees. 
This was a great way to improve my writing ability and think more deeply about data science topics. Eventually the scope of my role increased to the point where I took an active lead in organising and leading regular sessions as well as special events. 
  With the role of Data Ethics Club being actively supported in my role at the JGI, I take a leading role in maintaing the website, organising and chairing meetings, selecting suitable reading for discussions and inviting paper authors to attend discussion. 
  The brilliant <a href="https://jessica-woodgate.github.io/">Jessica Woodgate</a> now writes the blog and helps run sessions as well! </p>
    <p>Data Ethics Club is open to anyone with a wifi connection and you can find out more information on the website, including details about future meetings, seeing our extensive reading list and signing up to our mailing list! 
      All this talking about Data Ethics Club has inadvertently given me quite a lot to say on the topic. I've spoken at various events, mostly at UoB on Data Ethics and I'm always happy to chat more :)</p>
    
<h2>Intern Supervisor for <a href="https://jeangoldinginstitute.blogs.bristol.ac.uk/2024/09/04/chakaya-nyamvulas-jgi-placement/">Exploring Methods of Generating Synthetic Versions of Electronic Health Records</a> <h2>
<p>I know Chakaya Nyamvula as a student from a collaborating data science group iLab Africa at Strathmore University in Nairobi, Kenya which I had visiting in November 2023. Chakaya was working part time as a Business Intelligence Analyst with iLab Africa whilst doing her MSc in AI and Data Science at Keele University. For the summer placement section of her MSc, she worked as a paid research intern under the supervision of me!
As part of the continuation of a previous body of work on generating synthetic versions of electronic health records, Chakaya was tasked with accessing the MIMIC IV dataset of electronic health records, processing it and then using various methods to generate synthetic versions of it and benchmark the outputs. 
She experimented with more routine methods such as using kernel density estimation to emulate distributions of numerical data in a generative adversarial network which attempted to emulate the multi-variate distribution of the training data. This process was computationally and mathematically non-trivial, requiring her to adapt existing code to understand and implement a more appropriate metric for the task (a Wasserstein loss function).
Chakaya needed to use the JGI server for this task. All of her code was organised and well documented and stored in a <a href="https://github.com/chakaya/Synthetic-Data-Generation"> public GitHub repository</a>. She worked primarily remotely for a 10 week period, visiting our Bristol office twice. She attended Data Science team meetings diligently and took part in semi-structured coworking to learn more about the work we do at the JGI. 
At the end of the placement we presented her work to the University of Bristol Data Science seminar, attended by postgraduate researchers in data science and AI. The presentation was well attended and well received, with positive feedback about the quality and quantity of work and the level of insight into the methods used!
</p>
  <p>Working with Chakaya was a really lovely experience and I'm really excited to hear that she's now interested in applying for PhD programs, primarily in the UK, on AI related topics, especially uses of generative methods for synthetic data creation!</p>
